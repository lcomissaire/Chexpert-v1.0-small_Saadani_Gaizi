# Chexpert-v1.0-small_Saadani_Gaizi


The Data set we used is available at : https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/.


# DenseNet121

This Python 3 notebook is an implementation of the cheXpert baseline method. It uses a DenseNet121 architecture imported from PyTorch models.

The code presented here can be run in any computer without requirement of any GPU hardware. 
But for better time efficiency as the training data is very large, we recommend you to use cuda computing by running this code (after adjusting it) on a cloud gpu computing platform or on your own device if you have the required hardware.

# Actor-Critic RL:

This Python 3 notebook is an attempt of an RL classifier implementation, runnable in any device.
We based our implementation on the method describes in the articles below:
